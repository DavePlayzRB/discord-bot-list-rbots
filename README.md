# About
An open-sourced discord bot list.
There's a [setup guide in the wiki](https://github.com/Sank6/Discord-Bot-List/wiki/Setup-Information) if you're interested. Put all the information in `config.json`.
The development branch may have newer additions/features, but is also potentially more buggy or even insecure. Use at your own risk.
If you have any issues, check the [FAQs](https://github.com/Sank6/Discord-Bot-List/wiki/FAQs) first please.
